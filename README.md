### Petal Profits

Petal Profits is a personal finance and budgeting application. This app uses the analogy of growing a garden to help users better understand their finances and increase their financial literacy.

Users can use this app to track their income and expenses in a digestible way. They can also start a savings goal, what we call a Plant Goal. At the end of each month, the money a user has saved will go towards their goal and be used to water thiei plant. Once a goal is reached, a user can start a new one, and continue to grow their financial garden.


## Getting Started

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.


## Next steps
Things we would have liked to add to the app included:
- Being connected to real banks and pulling real-time data, ideally using Plaid's API
- Create a more complex banking account system where we can have shared bank accounts
- Have a login and register page
